# React-Native-UI-Templates

React-Native templates/kits for different types of apps

The templates are based on open source UI designs.
Feel free to use any of these templates as a starter/guide for your own app.

###
This is part of my self embarked #100-React-Native-Apps-In-100-Days Challenge
- Each app in this challenge will have at least 2 screens and will integrate some level of API logic. Either using store data with the Hooks API or some network request to an online API (REST/GraphQL)

### Usage and Setup
- Clone this repo. Open your terminal and navigate into any of the app folders e.g *cd courses_app* and run *yarn* to install the dependencies.
- Then run *yarn start* && *yarn android* in 2 separate terminals to run the app on an Android device. You could also run on iOS simulator too 

### Want to suggest a UI ?
